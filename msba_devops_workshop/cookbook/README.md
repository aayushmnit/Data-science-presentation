# Cookbook
A repository of data science codes written for re-usability and reducing the time taken from Idea to execution in developing a data science solution. This repository contains codes and sample notebooks to how to use these codes in building a data science solution.

### Codes - 
[Generic Preprocessing](https://github.com/aayushmnit/cookbook/blob/master/generic_preprocessing.py) - Helper functions to do EDA, missing value analysis & treatment and generic preprocessing like (scaling, encoding etc.)

[Machine learning - Classification](https://github.com/aayushmnit/cookbook/blob/master/ml_classification.py) - Helper functions to solve classification type problems in machine learning. It contains codes for holdout/cross validation, model explaination codes (LIME and variable importance plot), and codes for general classification algorithms (Xgboost, LightGBM, Extra trees, random forest, logistic regression, decision trees, K-nearest neighbours and SVM)

[Machine learning - Regression](https://github.com/aayushmnit/cookbook/blob/master/ml_regression.py) - Helper functions to solve regression type problems in machine learning. It contains codes for holdout/cross validation, model explaination codes (LIME and variable importance plot), and codes for general regression algorithms (Xgboost, LightGBM, Extra trees, random forest, linear regression, regression trees, K-nearest neighbours and SVM)

[Recommender systems](https://github.com/aayushmnit/cookbook/blob/master/recsys.py) - Helper functions to build recommender systems using Matrix factorization using LightFM package.

[Natural language processing](https://github.com/aayushmnit/cookbook/blob/master/nlp.py) - Helper functions for NLP text processing and analysis like N-grams, wordcloud, tokenization, lowercasing, punctuation/stopwords removal, stemmer/lemmatizer, TF-IDF & count vectorizer

### Notebooks - 
[Classification examples](https://github.com/aayushmnit/cookbook/tree/master/notebooks/classification) - Example notebooks to solve a classification problem

[Regression examples](https://github.com/aayushmnit/cookbook/tree/master/notebooks/regression) - Example notebooks to solve a regression problem
